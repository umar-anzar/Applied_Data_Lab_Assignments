Lists are commonly used to store collections of related values for various purposes. Let's explore how to create lists using both hard-coded values and a generalized approach.\n","\n","**Example 1: Hard-Coded Values**\n","```python\n","apple = ['red', '0.3g', 65, 'A']\n","print(apple)  # Output: ['red', '0.3g', 65, 'A']\n","```\n","\n","In this example, we directly created a list named `apple` with specific values.\n","\n","**Example 2: Generalized Approach**\n","```python\n","color = 'Red'\n","mass = '0.35g'\n","rs_per_kg = 72\n","vitamin = 'A'\n","apple = [color, mass, rs_per_kg, vitamin]\n","print(apple)  # Output: ['Red', '0.35g', 72, 'A']\n","```\n","\n","In this example, we used variables to store values and then created a list `apple` containing those variables. When we print the list, Python displays the values stored in the variables.\n","\n","It's important to note that when you use a print statement, Python outputs the values themselves, not the variable names. This distinction is essential because variables are part of the code's internal structure, while input and output statements (such as print) exist outside the code. Therefore, the values take precedence in the output.\n","\n","Remember this principle when working with lists and variables to ensure clear and accurate output."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Run this cell\n","color = 'Red'\n","mass = '0.35g'\n","rs_per_kg = 72\n","vitamin = 'A'\n","apple = [color, mass, rs_per_kg, vitamin]\n","print(apple)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"5AxXLn4PuEou","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1693135205116,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Umar Anzar","userId":"10020185523127189936"}},"outputId":"4e244ed5-b50f-4551-e381-9e5f0478244a"},"id":"5AxXLn4PuEou","execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['Red', '0.35g', 72, 'A']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Exercise 1: Creating and Customizing Lists\n","\n","**Objective:** Practice creating lists and customizing them with relevant data.\n","\n","**Instructions:** Consider the examples of the `fruits` and `teacher` lists provided below:\n","\n","1.

It means they can also hold other lists as elements, creating a structure known as a **multi-dimensional list** or a list of lists.\n","\n","**Now, let's search into why we use multi-dimensional lists and the benefits they offer:**\n","\n","First, let's review the concept of a single-dimensional list:\n","\n","Using a list, you can organize and access multiple values by indexing, as demonstrated in this example:\n","\n","example\n","```python\n","student_scores = [85, 90, 78]\n","print(student_scores[0])  # 90\n","print(student_scores[2])  # 78\n","```\n","\n","However, there are situations where a single-dimensional list isn't sufficient to represent complex data structures. This is where multi-dimensional lists come into play:\n","\n","Consider the scenario of a hundred students. Each student's information comprises their name, along with scores in English, Math, and Physics. Storing this information using individual variables for each student might lead to an unwieldy code:\n","```\n","st_1= [\"Alice\", 85, 92, 78]\n","st_2= [\"Bob\", 90, 88, 76]\n",". .\n",". .\n",". .\n",". .\n","st_100= [\"Zoe\", 78, 95, 82]\n","```\n","\n","As the number of students increases, so does the number of variables. This not only clutters the code but also makes it harder to manage.\n","\n","With multi-dimensional lists, you can organize and simplify the storage of such data:\n","\n","```python\n","students = [st_1,st_2,........,st_100]\n","```\n","or\n","```python\n","students = [\n","    [\"Alice\", 85, 92, 78],\n","    [\"Bob\", 90, 88, 76],\n","    # ... and so on for each student\n","    [\"Zoe\", 78, 95, 82]\n","]\n","```\n","\n","Now, each student's data is contained within a single list, and all these lists are organized within the `students` list. This approach makes it easier to manage and access student information.\n","\n","When printed, the `students` list would look like:\n","\n","```python\n","[\n","  [\"Alice\", 85, 92, 78],\n","  [\"Bob\", 90, 88, 76],\n","  .\n","  # ... and so on for each student\n","  .\n","  [\"Zoe\", 78, 95, 82]\n","]\n","```\n","\n","It provides a good structure, and now we can access easy student by single variable student using indexing.\n","\n","With this structure, you can conveniently access student information using indexing, just as you would with a single-dimensional list:\n","\n","```python\n","\n","print(students[0])  # ['Alice', 85, 92, 78]\n","print(students[1])  # ['Bob', 90, 88, 76]\n","# ... and so on for each student\n","print(students[99])  # ['Zoe', 78, 95, 82]\n","```\n","By organizing data in this way, you achieve better code organization and easier access to information.
