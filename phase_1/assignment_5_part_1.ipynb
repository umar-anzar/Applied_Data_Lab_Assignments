In this data structure, each word serves as a 'key,' and its meaning or definition corresponds to the 'value' of that key. Unlike lists or arrays that rely on numerical indices, dictionaries use keys for efficient data retrieval.\n","\n","### Why Use Dictionaries?\n","\n","1. **Meaningful Addressing:** Dictionaries excel at providing meaningful and easy-to-remember addresses for data. Instead of remembering numerical indices, you can use words or labels to access information. For example, storing a person's bio data under their name as a key makes it more intuitive to access.\n","\n","2. **Speedy Retrieval:** Dictionaries offer rapid data retrieval. When you know the key, accessing the associated value takes a single operation. This efficiency resembles how you might find a word in a physical dictionary by turning to a specific page based on the word's first letter.\n","\n","### Key Features of Dictionaries:\n","\n","- **Key Variety:** In dictionaries, keys can be of various data types, such as strings, integers, or floats, providing flexibility in addressing data.\n","\n","- **Value Versatility:** Similarly, values in dictionaries can hold diverse data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, or even nested dictionaries.\n","\n","- **Key-Value Pairing:** Dictionary entries consist of comma-separated key-value pairs, making it easy to organize and structure data.\n","\n","- **Key-Based Access:** The core principle of dictionaries is key-based access. You retrieve values by specifying the key associated with the data you want.\n","\n","- **Creating Dictionaries:** The default way to create a dictionary is by using curly braces. For instance:\n","  ```python\n","  employee = {\"Name\": \"Danial\", \"Age\": 24, \"Salary\": 50000.0}\n","  ```\n","\n","In summary, a dictionary is a highly versatile data structure that employs key-value pairs for organized and efficient data storage and retrieval. It's a powerful tool for tasks where meaningful addressing and quick data access are essential."],"metadata":{"id":"bQl2wTVx_RkQ"},"id":"bQl2wTVx_RkQ"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Exercise 1: Creating Dictionary\n","\n","**Example 1:**\n","\n","| Keys         | Key Data Type | Values          | Value Data Type |\n","|--------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n","| Book         | String        | Vampire         | String          |\n","| price        | String        | 100.5           | Float           |\n","| 0            | Integer       | light           | String          |\n","| 1            | Integer       | ['bulky', 30.4] | List            |\n","| 3            | Integer       | just-right      | String          |\n","\n","```python\n","a = { \"Book\": \"Vampire\", \"price\": 100.5, 0: 'light', 1: ['bulky', 30.4], 3: 'just-right'}\n","```\n"],"metadata":{"id":"V4yMs36LB2__"},"id":"V4yMs36LB2__"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Run this cell\n","a = {\"Book\":\"Vampire\", \"price\":100.5, 0:'light', 1:['bulky', 30.4], 3:'just-right'}\n","print(a)"],"metadata":{"id":"WcYED30w6uoy"},"id":"WcYED30w6uoy","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Task: Create a Dictionary**\n","\n","**Objective:** Create a Python dictionary that matches the provided table and print the dictionary.\n","\n","| Keys         | Key Data Type | Values           | Value Data Type |\n","|--------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|\n","| manufacturer | String        | Samsung          | String          |\n","| model        | String        | a6               | String          |\n","| camera       | String        | 13               | Integer         |\n","| 50           | Integer       | True             | Boolean         |\n","| weight       | String        | 2.25             | Float           |\n","| popularity   | String        | [23, 68, 46, 89] | List            |\n","\n","Task: Create a Python dictionary called `my_dictionary` that matches the provided table and print the `my_dictionary`."],"metadata":{"id":"yoYADMHOGHRf"},"id":"yoYADMHOGHRf"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Do Task: Create a Dictionary in this cell\n","#\n","#\n","#"],"metadata":{"id":"cYz2H2JuFp9H"},"id":"cYz2H2JuFp9H","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Exercise 2: Accessing Elements in a Dictionary\n","\n","Accessing elements in a dictionary is similar to how you access elements in a list or array, but instead of using indexes, you use keys enclosed in square brackets (`[]`) to retrieve their associated values.\n","\n","**Example 2:**\n","\n","```python\n","# Create a dictionary\n","my_dictionary = {\"Name\": \"John\", 30:\"abc\", \"Country\": \"USA\"}\n","\n","# Accessing elements using keys\n","name = my_dictionary[\"Name\"]\n","x = my_dictionary[30]\n","country = my_dictionary[\"Country\"]\n","\n","# Print the values\n","print(\"Name:\", name, \", x:\", x, \", Country:\", country)\n","```\n","\n","In this example, we create a dictionary called `my_dictionary`, and then we access its elements using the respective keys (`\"Name\"`, `30`, and `\"Country\"`) and store them in variables for printing.\n","\n","When you run this code, it will display:\n","\n","```\n","Name: John , x: abc , Country: USA\n","```\n","\n","**Note:** Remember that if you try to access a key that does not exist in the dictionary, it will result in an error."],"metadata":{"id":"5Q99R21AD6O3"},"id":"5Q99R21AD6O3"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Run this cell\n","my_dictionary = {\n","    \"Name\"    : \"John\",\n","    30        :\"abc\",\n","    \"Country\" : \"USA\"\n","    }\n","\n","name = my_dictionary[\"Name\"]\n","x = my_dictionary[30]\n","country = my_dictionary[\"Country\"]\n","\n","print(\"Name:\", name, \", x:\", x, \", Country:\", country)"],"metadata":{"id":"mUMxnh7nLYPF"},"id":"mUMxnh7nLYPF","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Task: Access Elements in a Dictionary**\n","\n","**Objective:** Access every element of this dictionary, save them in variables, and print their values.\n","\n","```python\n","point = {\n","  'x':30,\n","  'y':32,\n","  'z':3,\n","  50:502132,\n","  4.2: {60:20, \"abc\":\"xyz\"},\n","  \"hello\":\"world\"\n","  }\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"5bGGmu6CJg_K"},"id":"5bGGmu6CJg_K"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Do Task: Access Elements in a Dictionary in this cell\n","#\n","#\n","#"],"metadata":{"id":"a-8rButBJevG"},"id":"a-8rButBJevG","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Exercise 3: Adding New Key-Value Pairs to a Dictionary\n","\n","You can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary easily by the use of square bracket notation `[]` or the `update()` method.
