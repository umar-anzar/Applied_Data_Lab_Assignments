They perform specific tasks automatically, so we don't have to do them manually. Just like a coffee maker brews coffee or a light switch turns on a bulb, functions execute a particular set of instructions, making our code more efficient and organized. They allow us to repeat tasks effortlessly.\n","\n","**Real-Life Example: Coffee Maker**\n","\n","Imagine you have a coffee maker. Here's how it relates to functions:\n","\n","1. **Ingredients:** You have ingredients like coffee grounds and water.\n","\n","2. **Recipe:** You have a recipe, which is a set of instructions for making coffee. It says, \"Put coffee grounds in the filter, add water to the reservoir, press the 'brew' button, and wait for your coffee to be ready.\"\n","\n","Now, let's relate this to a function:\n","\n","- **Function:** Think of a function as a coffee-making program. It follows the same recipe (set of instructions) every time you run it. When you activate this program (`call` the function), it takes care of the entire coffee-making process automatically.\n","\n","- **Ingredients:** In programming, these are like the pieces of `data` or `variables` you want to work with, such as the amount of coffee grounds and water.\n","\n","- **Recipe:** This is like the `code` inside the function that tells it what to do with the ingredients. It might include steps like mixing the coffee grounds with water and heating the mixture.\n","\n","- **Calling the Function:** When you want to make coffee, you don't manually perform each step. Instead, you activate your coffee-making program (`call` the function), and it handles everything.\n","\n","- **Function Output:** The result/`return` of running the program is a fresh cup of coffee, ready for you to enjoy.\n","\n","So, in programming,\n","\n","A function is like a reusable set of instructions that takes input (ingredients), processes it according to a recipe (code), and produces output (coffee)."],"metadata":{"id":"tXDJjhKasPWT"},"id":"tXDJjhKasPWT"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Basic Function Structure\n","\n","In Python, you need to define a function before you can use it. This means that the function's code should appear in your script or program before you call or use that function.\n","\n","This rule ensures that Python knows what the function does before it's called, allowing for smooth execution without errors.\n","\n","So, when writing Python code, remember to define your functions before you use them.\n","\n","```python\n","def function_name(input_parameter1, input_parameter2):\n","    # Code goes here\n","    ...\n","    return output_result_variable\n","```\n","\n","- A function is defined using the `def` keyword.\n","- `function_name` can be any valid identifier.\n","- `input_parameter1` and `input_parameter2` serve as placeholders for the input values that the function accepts.\n","- A colon `:` is placed after the parameter brackets, and all the body is indented.\n","- `output_result_variable` can be any value that the function returns as output.\n","Now, let's understand functions with examples:\n","\n","**Example 1: A Simple Function**\n","\n","This function, `Greeting`, doesn't take any input parameters. It just prints a greeting message to John.\n","\n","```python\n","def Greeting():\n","    print(\"Hi, How are you, John?\")\n","\n","Greeting()  # Call the function\n","Greeting()  # Call it again\n","```\n","\n","**Output:**\n","```\n","Hi, How are you, John?\n","Hi, How are you, John?\n","```\n","\n","**Example 2: Function with Parameters**\n","\n","Here, the `Greeting` function takes a `name` parameter and prints a greeting message with that name.\n","\n","```python\n","def Greeting(name):\n","    print(\"Hi, how are you, \" + str(name) + \"?\")\n","\n","Greeting(\"Bilal\")  # Call with \"Bilal\" as the name\n","Greeting(\"Bruce\")  # Call with \"Bruce\" as the name\n","```\n","\n","**Output:**\n","```\n","Hi, how are you, Bilal?\n","Hi, how are you, Bruce?\n","```\n","\n","In the first example, the function prints the same message every time. In the second example, we pass a different name as an argument each time we call the function, and it customizes the greeting for us."],"metadata":{"id":"gxvc13nWO9si"},"id":"gxvc13nWO9si"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Run this cell\n","def Greeting():\n","    print(\"Hi, How are you, John?\")\n","\n","Greeting()\n","Greeting()"],"metadata":{"id":"u8YVJDDaL8oK"},"id":"u8YVJDDaL8oK","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Run this cell\n","def Greeting(name):\n","    print(\"Hi, how are you, \" + str(name) + \"?\")\n","\n","Greeting(\"Bilal\")\n","Greeting(\"Bruce\")"],"metadata":{"id":"oz4sKptuRV_4"},"id":"oz4sKptuRV_4","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Properties of Functions\n","\n","1. **Encapsulation:** Functions combine multiple instructions into a single line of code, simplifying complex tasks.\n","\n","2. **Modularity:** Functions break down tasks into reusable blocks, making code organized and maintainable.\n","\n","3. **Abstraction:** Functions hide the underlying code details, allowing users to focus on what the function does rather than how it does it.\n","\n","4. **Reusability:** Functions can be written once and used repeatedly throughout the code, promoting efficiency and reducing redundancy.\n","\n","5. **Input and Output:** Functions can take inputs (parameters) and produce outputs (return values), enhancing flexibility and adaptability.\n","\n","6. **Task Division:** Functions allow teams to divide a program into manageable parts, facilitating collaboration in large projects."],"metadata":{"id":"rC-yyTaNL9Y6"},"id":"rC-yyTaNL9Y6"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Example 3:**\n","\n","**Without Function:**\n","Suppose we have a list of marks, and we want to find out how many marks are lower than a given value, let's say 24. We can do this using a loop and a count variable:\n","\n","```python\n","marks = [1, 3, 5, 3, 2, 23, 45, 6, 4, 3, 3, 34, 5, 56, 8, 7, 6, 55, 4, 3, 4, 6, 5]\n","your_marks = 24\n","count = 0\n","\n","for i in marks:\n","    if i < your_marks:\n","        count += 1\n","\n","print(count)\n","```\n","\n","**With Function (Printing Count):**\n","Now, let's make this more organized using a function. We define a function called `valueGreaterThan` that takes two parameters: `data` (the list of marks) and `value` (the value to compare against). Inside the function, we use a loop and a count variable to find how many marks are lower than the given value. We then print the count.\n","\n","```python\n","def valueGreaterThan(data, value):\n","    count = 0\n","    for i in data:\n","        if i < value:\n","            count += 1\n","    print(count)\n","\n","marks = [1, 3, 5, 3, 2, 23, 45, 6, 4, 3, 3, 34, 5, 56, 8, 7, 6, 55, 4, 3, 4, 6, 5]\n","your_marks = 24\n","valueGreaterThan(marks, your_marks)  # Prints the count\n","```\n","\n","**With Function (Returning Count):**\n","But what if we want to use the count for something else, like saving it in a variable for later use? This is where the `return` keyword comes in. Instead of printing the count, we return it from the function. The function ends, and the returned value can be saved in a variable.\n","\n","```python\n","def valueGreaterThan(data, value):\n","    count = 0\n","    for i in data:\n","        if i < value:\n","            count += 1\n","    return count\n","\n","marks = [1, 3, 5, 3, 2, 23, 45, 6, 4, 3, 3, 34, 5, 56, 8, 7, 6, 55, 4, 3, 4, 6, 5]\n","your_marks = 24\n","count_variable = valueGreaterThan(marks, your_marks)  # count_variable = 19\n","```\n","\n","So, in summary, functions allow us to encapsulate a task, making our code more organized and reusable.
