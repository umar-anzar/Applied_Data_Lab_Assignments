Each student's information comprises their name, along with scores in English, Math, and Physics. Storing this information using individual variables for each student might lead to an unwieldy code:\n","```\n","st_1= [\"Alice\", 85, 92, 78]\n","st_2= [\"Bob\", 90, 88, 76]\n",". .\n",". .\n",". .\n",". .\n","st_100= [\"Zoe\", 78, 95, 82]\n","```\n","\n","As the number of students increases, so does the number of variables. This not only clutters the code but also makes it harder to manage.\n","\n","With multi-dimensional lists, you can organize and simplify the storage of such data:\n","\n","```python\n","students = [st_1,st_2,........,st_100]\n","```\n","or\n","```python\n","students = [\n","    [\"Alice\", 85, 92, 78],\n","    [\"Bob\", 90, 88, 76],\n","    # ... and so on for each student\n","    [\"Zoe\", 78, 95, 82]\n","]\n","```\n","\n","Now, each student's data is contained within a single list, and all these lists are organized within the `students` list. This approach makes it easier to manage and access student information.\n","\n","When printed, the `students` list would look like:\n","\n","```python\n","[\n","  [\"Alice\", 85, 92, 78],\n","  [\"Bob\", 90, 88, 76],\n","  .\n","  # ... and so on for each student\n","  .\n","  [\"Zoe\", 78, 95, 82]\n","]\n","```\n","\n","It provides a good structure, and now we can access easy student by single variable student using indexing.\n","\n","With this structure, you can conveniently access student information using indexing, just as you would with a single-dimensional list:\n","\n","```python\n","\n","print(students[0])  # ['Alice', 85, 92, 78]\n","print(students[1])  # ['Bob', 90, 88, 76]\n","# ... and so on for each student\n","print(students[99])  # ['Zoe', 78, 95, 82]\n","```\n","By organizing data in this way, you achieve better code organization and easier access to information.
