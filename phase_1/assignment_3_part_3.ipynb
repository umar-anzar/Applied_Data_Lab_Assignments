However, a computer program's **real strength emerges when dealing with repetitive tasks and large datasets**.\n","\n","For a **one-time calculation, doing it manually with paper and pencil is usually quicker**, considering the time needed to write, run, and interpret a program.\n","\n","But in scenarios where the **same calculation repeats many times, especially for vast datasets, computer programs excel**. Writing a program initially takes time, but its ability to perform tasks repeatedly and quickly is **invaluable**.\n","\n","Imagine tasks needing **thousands, millions, or billions of iterations**. Humans would struggle due to speed and potential errors. Computer programs execute iterations rapidly and accurately.\n","\n","This is where **loops step in**. Loops are programming tools that **run a specific block of code multiple times**, often with varying data. By programming these repetitions, you achieve what's **impractical manually**.\n","\n","In summary, while a **single calculation might favor manual work, computer programs shine when handling repetitions and significant data**. **Loops allow efficient automation**, enabling results **unattainable or excessively laborious otherwise**."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Without Loops"],"metadata":{"id":"Wyg1cpreOGoS"},"id":"Wyg1cpreOGoS"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Example 1:**\n","\n","Printing numbers from 0 to 9 using individual statements:\n","```python\n","print(\"Start\")\n","print(0)\n","print(1)\n","print(2)\n","print(3)\n","print(4)\n","print(5)\n","print(6)\n","print(7)\n","print(8)\n","print(9)\n","print(\"End\")\n","```\n","**Output:**\n","```\n","'Start'\n","0\n","1\n","2\n","3\n","4\n","5\n","6\n","7\n","8\n","9\n","'End'\n","```\n","\n","In the example above, you can observe that we have to write ten separate `print` statements to display numbers from 0 to 9.
