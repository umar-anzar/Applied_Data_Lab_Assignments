Writing a program initially takes time, but its ability to perform tasks repeatedly and quickly is **invaluable**.\n","\n","Imagine tasks needing **thousands, millions, or billions of iterations**. Humans would struggle due to speed and potential errors. Computer programs execute iterations rapidly and accurately.\n","\n","This is where **loops step in**. Loops are programming tools that **run a specific block of code multiple times**, often with varying data.
